					<h4>1. Brush your hair before you shower.</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">- No matter what your hair texture is, taking 60 seconds to detangle strands will keep them strong. "When your hair is wet it is more vulnerable to breakage," explains Brook, "so always brush knots out of your hair when it's dry." One added benefit: brushing dry hair distributes the natural oils from your scalp down to the ends of your hair. Another plus: post-shower it's already smooth and ready to style! <br><br>

						<h4>2. Condition correctly — and with care.</h4>
						<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-Unless your hair is long (read: Rapunzel-like), a nickel-size drop of conditioner is plenty for most textures and lengths. "Apply your conditioner first to the mid-shaft and ends of your hair; then work your way up to the scalp," advises Brook. It's important to make sure your scalp gets hydration as well. Leave it on for a full minute before washing it out. If you are a dry shampoo addict (no judgement!), this is especially important to prevent a dry scalp.<br><br>

							<h4>3. Take time for hair masks.</h4>
							<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
								To keep strands hydrated and smooth, "use a moisturizing hair mask or deep conditioner at least once a week, and more frequently if you use hot tools regularly," says Brook. Her go-to: Matrix Biolage HydraSource Deep Treatment Pack, which leaves hair feeling soft and shiny without weighing hair down.<br><br>


								<h4>4. Be mindful of key ingredients.</h4>
								<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
									Staring down the haircare aisle can be overwhelming: with endless haircare options, how do you choose the one? As you pick out your products, narrow down your options by looking for strengthening ingredients, which will nourish your strands. Brook suggests incorporating coconut oil, Argan oil, aloe, or spirulina into your regimen.<br><br>

									<h4>5. Eat a balanced diet.</h4>
								<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
									You already know that you are what you eat. "Your hair is mostly made up of protein, so eating a balanced diet of protein rich food is important," says Brook. Add these items to your grocery list:Fish,Meat,Eggs,Beans<br><br>

									<h4>6. Take a deep breath.</h4>
									<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
										Repeat after us: breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. The little things make a big difference. "Your hair is an outgrowth of your body; if you are stressed, your skin will be stressed and that includes your scalp." Now, keep calm and read on.
										<br><br>

										<h4>7. Turn down the temp of your shower.</h4>
									<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
										As soothing as a steamy show may feel, "taking a super hot shower on a daily basis can irritate you scalp and possibly weaken your hair as it grows out," says Brook. Keep the temperature on the warm side and at the end of the shower, do a quick cold-water rinse to seal the cuticles shut, boost shine, and maintain healthy hair.<br><br>
										
										<h4>8. Shield strands from the sun.</h4>
										<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
											UV rays don't only cause damage to your skin, and the same goes for pollution. When you style your hair, "apply a leave-in styler to protect your strands," says Brook. She recommends antioxidant-rich Coola Organic Scalp and Hair Mist SPF 30, which guards against an array of environmental factors.<br><br>

											<h4>9. Don't skip your scalp.</h4>
											<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-
												Healthy hair starts with a healthy scalp. "If you’re notice dryness, itching, or any scalp issues, your hair will be affected by this," says Brook. To maintain a balanced scalp, Brook recommends her long-time go-to for clarifying the scalp: Head & Shoulders Classic Clean Shampoo and Conditioner. The result? Voluminous, fresh hair.<br><br>
